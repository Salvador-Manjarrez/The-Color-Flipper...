# The-Color-Flipper...
A simple application that changes the background color of the page (The HTML's body). This is part of a series of tutorials im studying from freeCodeCamp(). JavaScript is such an interesting language! I have been really amazed lately. There is indeed so much to learn...

Clicking fires the functions for the color changing. This was conceibed thanks to the arrays constitution and the way they can be easyly manipulated. With the use of loops, Math,
and other useful elements, we are able to generate a whole random combination for the Hexadecimal numeration that then get pushed to the HTML's body to actually affect it thanks
to the   querySelector   and the   getElement   methods. Similar task is accomplished by the   index.html   but in a simplier fashion.

This exercises make me exited! I feel so much love and respect for what computer scientists and engineers have geniously created. Thanks all and everyone one of you.
